                Resumeee aims to provide a free, powerful, and user-friendly tool to help job seekers create professional resumes and cover letters. By leveraging AI and providing a clean, modern interface, it seeks to level the playing field, making high-quality application materials accessible to everyoneâ€”without hidden fees, subscriptions, or data harvesting.

              <p>
                Your resume data is saved automatically and securely in your
                browser's local storage. This allows you to refresh the page or
                close the browser and still have your progress restored when you
                return.

                However, this means that if you clear your browser's cache or

                from your machine.

              Why do I need an API key for AI features?

              <p>
                This application integrates with powerful third-party AI models
                from providers like Google and OpenAI to offer features like
                content improvement and resume parsing. These services require
                an API key for authentication and to manage usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using your own key, you get direct access to these
                state-of-the-art tools within the resume builder.

              <p>
                Absolutely. Your API key and all your resume content are stored
                exclusively in your browser's local storage. They are{' '}
                <span className="font-bold">

                </span>{' '}
                When you use an AI feature, your browser sends the necessary
                data directly to the AI provider you select (e.g., Google,
                OpenAI).
              </p>
              <p>
                Your information remains on your machine and under your
                control.

              How does the ATS Score Checker work?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="space-y-2 text-sm">
              <p>
                The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Score Checker is an
                AI-powered simulation. It analyzes your resume or cover letter
                against the job description you provide, just like a real ATS
                might.
              </p>
              <p>
                It identifies matching keywords, assesses formatting from a
                machine-readability standpoint, and finds skill gaps to help
                you tailor your application and increase your chances of
                getting noticed by recruiters.

            <AccordionContent className="space-y-2 text-sm">
              <p>
                Yes! You can edit your resume and use all non-AI features
                completely offline. Since all your data is stored in your
                browser, you don't need an internet connection to access or
                modify your content.
              </p>
              <p>
                An internet connection is only required when you use the
                AI-powered features (like parsing, content improvement, or ATS
                checks) as they need to communicate with the external AI
                providers.
